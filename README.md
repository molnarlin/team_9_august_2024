Welcome to Frogs of Fury, a retro-inspired action game that pays homage to the classic "Contra" while offering a fresh, vertical challenge. In this game, players must navigate their way through an endless vertical landscape by leaping from platform to platform, all while avoiding or defeating various enemies. The higher you go, the more perilous the journey becomes. But beware: the map dissolves beneath you, so any missed jump or hesitation could lead to your demise. Whether playing solo or with a friend in co-op mode, your goal is to ascend as high as possible and survive the relentless challenges thrown your way.

# Design

## Color Scheme

The HTML pages for "Frog of Fury" employ a dark and vibrant color scheme designed to enhance the game's retro atmosphere while maintaining readability and focus.

### HTML pages

- **Primary Colors:** The overall background uses a deep, almost black shade (#00000b), creating a stark contrast with bright elements.
- **Accent Colors:** Vivid green (#00ff00) is used for borders and highlights, adding a neon-like glow that emphasizes interactive elements.
- **Text and Backgrounds:** White (#ffffff) and slightly off-white tones are used for text and background panels to ensure clarity against the dark background, with subtle shadow effects adding depth.

### Characters

The characters in "Frog of Fury" are designed with distinct color palettes that emphasize their roles and enhance the visual contrast against the game’s environments.

- **Player 1:** The character sprites use dark tones (#02060A) with vibrant highlights, ensuring visibility against diverse backgrounds.
- **Player 2 Variant:** This sprite has a unique color scheme dominated by dark purples (#390062), differentiating it from the primary character.
- **Mosquito:** The mosquito sprites feature sharp contrasts with black (#000000) and light cyan tones (#E3F7EB) to stand out as enemies.
- **Snake:** The snake sprite combines deep blacks (#000000) with electric blues (#0A50FF), giving it a cold, mechanical feel.

### Gameplay Map

The color scheme for "Frog of Fury" draws heavily from natural and earthy tones, combined with bright, contrasting colors that enhance the retro gaming feel. 

- **Dirt Tile:** A range of warm browns (e.g., #9C5A3C) gives the game environment a grounded, earthy feel. These shades provide a natural look, reminiscent of soil and dirt.
- **Lava Tile:** Vivid oranges and reds (e.g., #EF6C00, #FFA726) dominate this tile, capturing the intense heat and danger associated with lava. These colors contrast sharply with the other more muted tones.
- **Platform Tile:** Shades of green (e.g., #4CAF50, #22B14C) are used, evoking the lushness of nature. This green palette is critical for representing the platforms and safe zones the player interacts with.
- **Wall Tile:** Muted browns and dark grays (e.g., #4A312B, #6B473D) provide a solid, sturdy appearance, reinforcing the feeling of immovable obstacles in the game.
